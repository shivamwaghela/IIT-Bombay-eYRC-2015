# IIT Bombay's National Robotics Competition 2015

  e-Yantra Robotics Competition (eYRC) is a unique annual competition for undergraduate students in science and engineering colleges. Selected teams are given a robotic kit complete with accessories and video tutorials to help them learn basic concepts in embedded systems and microcontroller programming. Abstracts of real world problems assigned as "themes" are then implemented by the teams using the robotic kits.
  
## Theme - Recyclable Waste Management

### Description

Garbage Collection is one of the most important urban services provided by local Government bodies. Waste is an inevitable end product of the various human activities. Proper collection, storage, transportation and disposal are imperative to ensure cleanliness and sanitation in our cities. For effective management of municipal solid waste, it has to be collected in a segregated manner avoiding manual handling of the waste, transported in closed containers, processed and disposed scientifically in a landfill site.
With increased awareness, waste is segregated at source and the recyclable waste is collected by local agencies in many localities using Collection Vehicles. Such waste is then handed over to the Garbage Trucks which consolidate the waste from an entire township to transport it to the landfill site.

This theme focuses our attention to the problem of consolidation of collected recyclable waste. In this theme, the arena represents one locality of a city. One robot which is a Collection Vehicle collects the recyclable waste from designated pick up points in the locality. The challenge is for the Collection Vehicle to transfer the collected waste to another robot – a Garbage Truck – that goes around the locality.
